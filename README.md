# Pulse_Width_Measurement-by-8051-in-Assembly-Language
Microcontroller Programming using Assembly language to measure frequency , duty cycle and generate frequency (0-65536Hz)

The project is done both using proteus simulation as well as Using Hardware ( 8051 microcontroller Board )

![8051 Microcontroller Board](https://github.com/Mainul-Islam-07/Pulse_Width_Measurement-by-8051-in-Assembly-Language/assets/78782260/b72cd060-29c3-4286-8656-afa5c84d5c4f)

The above figure contains the hardware required to run the tests as well as monitoring the outputs. This is like a testbench. Here link analyser is the alternate of using an oscilloscope as its too expensive . Arduino mega is used to generate frequencies and provide to the 8051 microcontroller board.

Wiring in the diagram is not the actual. It will be re-uploaded soon. The above figure is given for a quick understanding. 

Features:

1. Measure the frequency and duty cycle of a signal and display it on the LCD. If it is less/more than
50Hz sound an alarm and specify the difference on the LCD.

2. Take two signals, measure their frequencies and generate a new signal equal to the sum of
those frequencies.

3. Continuously carry out the above tasks and LED 1 should be turned on when the first task is
being carried out, and LED 2 should be turned on when the second task is being carried on.

Optional Features that were Implemented:

1: To run the system in both continuous looping or upor pressing button

2: To compare 2 input frequencies and show them by 3 led turning on and off depending upon being equal, smaller or greater.

CODE and Proteus simulation will be uploaded Soon, keep in touch (after 15th Jan,23)
